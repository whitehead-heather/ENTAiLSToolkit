Primary Consideration,Details,Minimum Guidance,Best Guidance
Generating qualitative results based on study design questions ,"NTA can answer much broader hypotheses than traditional targeted analysis methods. Common study design approaches include:  1) Determine the presence of chemicals of concern. 2) Investigate origin and impact of specific point sources. 3) Measure the distribution of chemicals across time, space, and/or matrices (e.g. water, soil, plants, animals, people). 4) Estimate or model the fate and transport of pollutants. 5) Establish the association of chemicals with other factors.",Identify study goals and hypotheses and ensure compatibility of research questions to the types and amount of experimental and reference data available,"Define data processing (software, tools) and analysis (basic and higher-level statistics, computational modeling) requirements needed to address hypotheses"
Generating quantitative results based on study design questions,Quantitative results may be necessary to ask fundamental questions like: 1) Do measured concentrations exceed statutory guidelines (e.g. drinking water limits)? 2) Can chemical levels represent a risk based on known toxicological/fate/exposure information?,"Utilize complimentary analysis techniques (e.g., targeted analysis) to generate quantitative results",Prepare samples and acquire data to support quantitative NTA modeling approaches. Consult qNTA experts
Sample collection methods,Sample collection methods should be chosen with respect to the chemical space of both the chemical classes and the matrices being investigated. For NTA it is likely that limited guidance is available for all classes of interest and the combination of different guidance or testing of collection methods may be required,Utilize existing documentation from federal and state agencies to support plans. Collect QA/QC samples described in Appendix B,"Ensure compatibility of sample collection methods derived from targeted analysis techniques with NTA methods (e.g., examine negative and positive bias)"
Negative bias,"The loss of PFAS during sample collection, preparation, and storage. PFAS loss is dependent on fluorinated tail chain length and functional groups",Identify potential routes of PFAS loss or gain based on existing research from targeted analysis investigations. Utilize matched isotopically-labeled compounds spiked at known concentrations to track PFAS loss or gain,"Ensure tools, consumables, or products used during sample collection do not introduce positive or negative bias in the chemical space measured by NTA"
Positive bias,"The introduction of PFAS during sample collection, preparation, and storage. PFAS gain is estimated to be due to the use of PFAS in various consumer products, laboratory supplies, and due to its ubiquity in the environment",Identify potential routes of PFAS loss or gain based on existing research from targeted analysis investigations. Utilize matched isotopically-labeled compounds spiked at known concentrations to track PFAS loss or gain,"Ensure tools, consumables, or products used during sample collection do not introduce positive or negative bias in the chemical space measured by NTA"
Sample preparation methods,"The choice of sample preparation methods is dependent on the chemical classes, matrices, and research questions being investigated. NTA work for PFAS have utilized the sample preparation techniques employed for targeted analysis, though, these methods often narrow the measurable chemical space","Utilize existing sample preparation techniques (organic solvent extractions, SPE, QuEChERS) that are validated for targeted analyses of PFAS. Collect QA/QC samples described in Appendix B","Ensure compatibility of sample collection methods derived from targeted analysis techniques with NTA methods (e.g., examine negative and positive bias). Develop and validate sample preparation techniques to capture a wider chemical space for NTA as needed"
Sample separation (LC) methods,Many liquid chromatography (LC) methods have been developed to support the analysis of PFAS using targeted and NTA methods. These methods primarily use reversed phase chromatography to separate PFAS based on their hydrophobicity,Utilize existing separation methods (reversed phase LC) that are validated for targeted analyses of PFAS. Acquire QA/QC samples described in Appendix B,"Adapt existing methods or develop new separation methods to optimize the measurement of select PFAS (e.g., ultra-shorts, semi-volatile). Use complimentary techniques (GC-MS, GC-MS/MS) to capture select PFAS"
Ionization,"Both targeted and NTA methods for PFAS utilize electrospray ionization (ESI) in negative mode to measure anionic PFAS. Solution chemistry and sample matrix play a significant role in the efficiency of ionization and the generation of adducts, in-source fragments, and multimers during ionization","Utilize ESI in negative mode to capture the commonly-measured anionic PFAS. Optimize sample matrix, solvent phase, and ion source conditions to minimize the generation of adducts, in-source fragments, or multimers when possible. Acquire QA/QC samples described in Appendix B","Optimize ion source conditions to improve sensitivity for PFAS measured by NTA that aren’t included in targeted analyses. Consider the use of other ionization sources or techniques to measure select PFAS (zwitterionic, cationic)"
Mass analysis methods,NTA methods use high-resolution mass spectrometry to permit the advanced data processing required of NTA methods. A handful of different high-resolution mass analyzers are available and the data acquisition methods used can be generally classified as either data dependent or data independent,Utilize generalized data dependent or data independent acquisition methods to support measurement of a wider chemical space. Determine if data dependent or independent acquisition is needed to support study questions and check compatibility with data processing tools. Acquire QA/QC samples described in Appendix B,"Use inclusion and exclusion lists to optimize MS2 data acquisition. Consider the use of multiple injections or the use of advanced techniques (e.g., iterative exclusion) to capture rich MS2 data"
