Column name in results,Description of data,Additional context
ID_Ranked,"Contains strings of identifiers that relate to the annotation given by FluoroMatch, including chemical names, sub-class names, molecular formulas, SMILES, and ion form",Sometimes includes a DTXSID that can be used to help identify the exact chemical that FluoroMatch annotated 
Frags,"Contains information on the ion form(s) of observed fragments in the experimental spectra that were matched to ""real"" acquired spectra","Individual fragments are separated by a semi-colon. Different spectra are separated by a bar. The information here is linked to the ""Num_Frags"" and ""Files"" columns."
Num_Frags,"Contains information on the number of observed fragments in the experimental spectra that were matched to ""real"" acquired spectra","Individual fragments are separated by a semi-colon. Different spectra are separated by a bar. The information here is linked to the ""Frags"" and ""Files"" columns."
Files,"Contains information on which files had the observed fragments in the experimental spectra that were matched to ""real"" acquired spectra","Individual fragments are separated by a semi-colon. Different spectra are separated by a bar. The information here is linked to the ""Num_Frags"" and ""Frags"" columns."
Frags.1,Contains information on the ion form(s) of observed fragments in the experimental spectra that were matched to predicted spectra,"Individual fragments are separated by a semi-colon. Different spectra are separated by a bar. The information here is linked to the ""Num_Frags"" and ""Files"" columns."
Num_Frams.1,Contains information on the number of observed fragments in the experimental spectra that were matched to predicted spectra,"Individual fragments are separated by a semi-colon. Different spectra are separated by a bar. The information here is linked to the ""Frags"" and ""Files"" columns."
Files.1,Contains information on which files had the observed fragments in the experimental spectra that were matched to predicted spectra,"Individual fragments are separated by a semi-colon. Different spectra are separated by a bar. The information here is linked to the ""Num_Frags"" and ""Frags"" columns."
2+_homologous_series,Identifies features where FluoroMatch observes the feature as being part of a homologous series with at least one other feature occurring at a mass above or below it within a homologous series ,"Given by a TRUE/FALSE, where TRUE means the feature is within a homologous series"
3+_homologous_series,Identifies features where FluoroMatch observes the feature as being part of a homologous series with at least two other feature occurring at a mass above or below it within a homologous series ,"Given by a TRUE/FALSE, where TRUE means the feature is within a homologous series"
Number_of_F_Fragments,Summarizes the total number of fluorine-containing fragments identified by FluoroMatch,"Generally level 2s will have a greater number of fluorine-containing fragments. Shorter-chain PFAS tend to have fewer numbers of fluorine-containing fragments, so a low number here does not alone work to filter out probable/improbable PFAS. "
MD,Identifies annotated features whose calculated Kendrick Mass Defect falls within the typical PFAS space for KMD values,"Given by a TRUE/FALSE, where TRUE means the value is within the KMD range"
Likely_PFAS,Takes an aggregate of all data generated/annotated by FluoroMatch to define whether or not the data support the likelihood of that feature being PFAS or not,"Given by a TRUE/FALSE, where TRUE means FluoroMatch thinks this is a PFAS. Note that even some Level 2s can be annotated with a ""FALSE"" and this column alone isn't a suitable predictor for actual PFAS presence "
