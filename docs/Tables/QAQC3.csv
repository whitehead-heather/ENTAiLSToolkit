Solvent Blank,"Diluent used to prepare final sample extracts, not spiked with any native or internal standards used in the study","Identifies any presence of native or isotopically-labeled compounds present in the diluent or the instrument, due to carryover or contamination of mobile phases",Inject a solvent blank every n injections and before and after any samples containing spiked native compounds*,Inject a solvent blank at the start and end of each analytical batch
Laboratory Blank,"Diluent used to prepare final sample extracts, spiked with internal standards used in the study",Measures the response of isotopically-labeled compounds in the same solvent composition as samples (excluding matrix). Can be used to ensure instrument performance is stable across injections/batches ,Inject a laboratory blank near the start of each analytical batch and every n injections within the batch* ,Prepare a laboratory blank for each set of samples and prepare a new laboratory blank if multiple diluents are used for a single batch of samples. Inject at the start of each analytical batch and at least two more times during the batch
Control or System Suitability Mixture,"Diluent used to prepare final sample extracts, spiked with native and internal standards used in the study",Measures the response of both native and isotopically-labeled compounds in the same solvent composition as samples (excluding matrix). Can be used to ensure accurate quantification  ,Inject a control near the start of each analytical batch and every n injections within the batch. If producing quantitative data using a calibration curve inject both a low concentration and mid-range concentration control* ,Prepare a control for each set of samples and prepare a new control if multiple diluents are used for a single batch of samples. Inject at the start of each analytical batch and at least two more times during the batch
