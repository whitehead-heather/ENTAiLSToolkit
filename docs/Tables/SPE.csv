Retention Mechanism,"Interactions driven by non-polar or hydrophobic behavior, through Van der Waals or dispersion forces","Interactions driven by polar interactions, through hydrogen bonding, pi-pi, dipole-dipole, and induced dipole-dipole forces",Interactions driven by electrostatic attraction between a charged analyte to an oppositely charged sorbent
Analyte Characteristics,"Analytes have non-polar functionality. This includes most organic analytes, especially those with alkyl, aromatic, and alicyclic functional groups","Analytes have polar functionality. This includes hydroxyl, amine, and alkene functional groups as well as heteroatoms and resonance structures",Analytes are either acids (in anion exchange) or bases (in cation exchange)
Sample Matrix Characteristics,"Aqueous based. Includes biological samples, tissue extracts, and environmental waters","Non-polar, organic extracts. Includes fatty oils and hydrocarbons","Aqueous or organic based, with low salt concentrations. Includes biological fluids or solution phase synthesis samples"
Elution Considerations,Analytes eluted from solid phase by disrupting non-polar interactions using stronger solvents with stronger non-polar characteristics,Analytes eluted from solid phase by disrupting polar interactions using solvents with stronger polar characteristics,Analytes eluted from solid phase by disrupting electrostatic interactions by introducing salt or modifying pH (to remove analyte or solid phase charge)
